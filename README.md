## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent skills are **self-contained capability packages** that extend what AI coding agents can do. Each skill bundles:

- **SKILL.md** — Instructions the agent reads to understand when and how to use the skill
- **Scripts** — Executable automation (bash, Node.js, Python) the agent can invoke
- **References** — API docs, schemas, and domain knowledge loaded on-demand
- **Extensions** — Optional plugin modules with typed tools and configs

Think of them as **apps for your AI agent** — install one, and your agent gains an entirely new domain of expertise.
